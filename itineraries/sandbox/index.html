           <p>A picturesque stone bridge dating back to the first century AD. You can walk right across and it is a perfect starting
          point to visiting the historic parts of the city. Great photo op spot!</p>

           <p>The 12th century and 16th century cathedrals were merged together to form one place. Although tickets are required for
          entry, you can purchase these on site when you are ready to enter. For an extra â‚¬4 you are allowed access to the top of
          the bell tower of the old cathedral for an amazing view.</p>
