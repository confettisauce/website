        <h2 class="date-welcome-message">Sintra exploration day!</h2>
        <p class="note">My recommendation is to get an early start on this day, as it can become jammed with tourists the later the day goes on. I also recommend packing snacks, SPF, and water.</p>
        <p>Getting to Sintra via public transportation could not be any easier! After fueling up with a good breakfast, walk 12 minutes from your hotel to the Cais do Sodré train station. Trains to Sintra leave twice every hour. </p>
        <p>After arriving in Sintra via train, you'll want to purchase bus tickets for the 434. This is the tourist hop on/hop off sightseeing bus. The bus ticket office is opposite the train station, you can't miss it upon arrival. Purchase the 434 loop ticket.</p>
        <p>After hopping on the bus, ride it until it stops at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/P1AmG3kZrNAZPGku6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castelo Dos Mouros</a>, a 10th century castle. Tickets can be purchased upon arrival.</p>
        <p>Hop back on the 434 and ride to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ncZPJjgWRiU32tAi6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National Palace of Pena</a>, a rainbow painted palace surrounded by explorable park greenery and ruins. Tickets can be purchased upon arrival.</p>
        <p>Hop back on the 434 and ride it to the historic town center, where you can relax for a bit and get something to eat. Notable options include:</p>

        <p>When you're finished exploring, walk back to the town center bus stop and ride the 434 back to the train station to head back to your hotel.</p>
        <p><strong>8:30pm:</strong> Dinner reservations at the gorgeous <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UQY8KbvcU3Za1LJf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javá Rooftop</a>.</p>
        <p class="note">This restaurant has your credit card on file because it is a &#8364;10 per person charge if you no-show. They hold the table for 15 minutes. I also discovered the outdoor area is apparently pet friendly so fingers crossed you see some dogs!</p>
